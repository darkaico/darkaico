### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working at Blacklane as an Engineering Manager, leading product and platform teams focused on growth and high-impact initiatives.
- 🤓 I enjoy working with Python, Ruby on Rails, and TypeScript, often building web apps, APIs, and internal tools. Lately, I've been diving into Phaser.js for game development and Figma plugins with React.
- 🎮 I’m building a web-based 2D multiplayer game using TypeScript, Phaser, and Docker — with a shared monorepo architecture and real-time backend.
- 🧩 I care about architecture, testing strategies, and developer experience, and love turning complex systems into maintainable and scalable ones.
- 💬 Ask me about APIs, Rails monoliths, testing strategies, architecture, or anything related to Figma plugin development.
- 📫 You can find me online as @darkaico on most platforms
